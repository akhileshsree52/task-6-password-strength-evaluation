Password Strength Evaluation Report

1. Objective
The objective of this task is to understand what makes a password strong and to evaluate password strength using an online password strength checker.

2. Tool Used
- Online Password Strength Checker (passwordmonster.com)

3. Passwords Tested

Password 1:
- Password: password123
- Strength Level: Weak
- Feedback: Lacks complexity, predictable, easy to guess.

Password 2:
- Password: Password@123
- Strength Level: Medium
- Feedback: Includes uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols but could be longer.

Password 3:
- Password: P@55w0rd!#2026Secure
- Strength Level: Strong
- Feedback: High complexity, long length, resistant to common attacks.

4. Key Observations
- Longer passwords are significantly stronger.
- Using uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols improves security.
- Predictable patterns reduce password strength.

5. Common Password Attacks
- Brute Force Attack: Tries all possible combinations.
- Dictionary Attack: Uses common words and leaked passwords.

6. Best Practices Learned
- Use passwords with at least 12–16 characters.
- Avoid common words and personal information.
- Combine different character types.
- Use passphrases when possible.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA).

7. Conclusion
Password complexity and length play a critical role in protecting accounts against unauthorized access. Strong passwords significantly reduce the risk of brute force and dictionary attacks.
